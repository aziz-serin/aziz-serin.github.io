    <h2 class="text-secondary">About Me</h2>

    <p class="text-white">
        I have finished my second year in the University of Manchester, and currently doing a year-long internship in ForgeRock.Inc.
        As you can see, I am not very interested in front-end and design stuff, but if you want a website or an app with a solid back-end
        I am your guy. My CV is attached below, feel free to contact me for any fun projects. I am aware I have some very bad designs or just straight out bad quality code in some of my projects
        from my inexperienced times, but feel free to reach out to point my mistakes, make comments on the files and so on. I promise I do not bite)
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-secondary">What Did I Do So Far?</h2>

    <p class="text-white">
        I usually work on small projects in my own time. You can see some of them in this repo, including my flat-tracker (very useful in the current house market), twitter bot (will probably
        be useless if Elon Musk continues acting like this with Twitter) and a youtube downloader (Which I am thinking of turning into a desktop app for downloading mp4 files from youtube and
        playing them locally on your machine, because sometimes there are songs/clips only on youtube which I cannot find on spotify). The apps I have built or work on are usually are apps
        that solve some problems I have, but I know these things are not only problems for me. So feel free to use anything you see on my github page. I love writing code and making new things to solve
        problems in the world, so as I have said, let me know if you have an interesting project you want to build just to try out a new tech, or to solve an issue.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-secondary">What Do I want to Do in The Future?</h2>

    <p class="text-white">
        As I have mentioned above, I am interested in back-end. Currently I am working on a website which will help small businesses to manage their structure, e.g., track their expenses,
        manage employee records, keep track of their stock information and incoming/outgoing orders. Currently this project is developed under a private repo by me until it becomes ready, because
        right now it is not ready. But if interested, drop me an email with your github account so I can give access privilege to the repo. The website is being developed using java11 and spring
        framework. I am planning to make this website as an open-source alternative to existing business management websites for the small-business owners, to cut down their expenses a bit more
        and have community support for the website. I know it sounds a bit far fetched, but you never know without trying, right!
    </p>
