    <h2 class="text-secondary">About Me</h2>

    <p class="text-white">
        I just finished my second year in the University of Manchester, and will be doing placement for 2022-2023 year.
        As you can see, I am not very interested in front-end and design stuff, but if you want a website or an app with a solid back-end
        I am your guy. My CV is attached below, feel free to contact me for any fun projects or something else.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-secondary">What Did I Do So Far?</h2>

    <p class="text-white">
        I have worked on different types of projects, which includes machine learning, web development, some small scripts to automate stuff, twitter bot,
        youtube downloader, and so on. I can work comfortably with Java and Python, and I have used different frameworks such as Spring, Flask, openCV, javaFX and so on. I have
        also worked with SQL and NOSQL database technologies in different projects. I can work with C/C++ but I would not say I am as confident with C/C++ as I am with
        Java and Python. I have also worked with node.js for a small project I have tried out, which you can see in my github repos.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-secondary">What Do I want to Do in The Future?</h2>
    <p class="text-white">
        As I have mentioned above, I am interested in backend. I am looking into a little bit of Swift at the moment for app development, and I have built some distributed systems
        in the university. Everything you see on my github is my personal projects, so If you are a recruiter and you are curious about other things I have done, feel free to contact me
        so I can show the school stuff which is in my gitlab account. Note that my CV may not be up-to-date all the time, so again, feel free to contact me so I can send the up-to-date version
        if you are interested.
    </p>
